FamicomDojo.TV Website (PHP)

This project is for a website consisting of may separate yet related systems, which include the following:

Video repository:
Collecting information about original video content that may exist on several video services,
but coillating them into one master page.  This includes show notes (that each video service
would point to), and other cross-system relationships and information.

Podcast repository:
Similar to the Video repository, but also is responsible for creating and maintaining the data behind 
the podcast RSS feed.

Games library:
A place to go to discover information about video game consoles, add-ons, peripherals, and individual games. 
Likely has relationships to original videos and podcasts on the site.
